We then initialize two additional dense layers, labeled as $A$ and $B$, with shapes $d \\times r$ and $r \\times d$, respectively. Here, $r$ denotes the rank, which is typically **much smaller than** $d$. Prior to LoRA, the model's output was computed using the equation $output = W_0 \\cdot x + b_0$, where $x$ represents the input and $b_0$ denotes the bias term associated with the original dense layer, which remains frozen. After applying LoRA, the equation becomes $output = (W_0 \\cdot x + b_0) + (B \\cdot A \\cdot x)$, where $A$ and $B$ denote the trainable rank-decomposition matrices that have been introduced.\n","\n","<center><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/DWsbhLg/LoRA.png\" width=\"300\"><br/>\n","Credit: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685\">LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models</a> Paper</center>\n","\n","In the LoRA paper, $A$ is initialized with $\\mathcal{N} (0, \\sigma^2)$ and $B$ with $0$, where $\\mathcal{N}$ denotes the normal distribution, and $\\sigma^2$ is the variance.\n","\n","**Why does LoRA save memory?**\n","\n","Even though we're adding more layers to the model with LoRA, it actually helps save memory. This is because the smaller layers (A and B) have fewer parameters to learn compared to the big model and fewer trainable parameters mean fewer optimizer variables to store. So, even though the overall model might seem bigger, it's actually more efficient in terms of memory usage.\n","\n","> This notebook uses a LoRA rank of `4`.
