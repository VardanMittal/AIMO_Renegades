This notebook will guide you through the process of fine-tuning the **Gemma** LLM model with LoRA to solve math problems using KerasNLP. With KerasNLP, fine-tuning with LoRA becomes straightforward with just a few lines of code.\n\n**Did you know:**: This notebook is backend-agnostic? Which means it supports TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX backends. However, the best performance can be achieved with `JAX`. KerasNLP and Keras enable the choice of preferred backend. Explore further details on [Keras](https://keras.io/keras_3/).\n\n**Note**: For a deeper understanding of KerasNLP, refer to the [KerasNLP guides](https://keras.io/keras_nlp/).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Install Libraries\n\nWe need to install latest KerasNLP to load Gemma 1.1 model.

They can be integrated into applications and run on various platforms including mobile devices and hosted services. Developers can customize Gemma models using tuning techniques to enhance their performance for specific tasks, offering more targeted and efficient generative AI solutions beyond text generation.\n\nGemma models are available in several sizes so we can build generative AI solutions based on your available computing resources, the capabilities you need, and where you want to run them.\n\n| Parameters size | Tuned versions    | Intended platforms                 | Preset                 |\n|-----------------|-------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| 2B              | Pretrained        | Mobile devices and laptops         | `gemma_2b_en`          |\n| 2B              | Instruction tuned | Mobile devices and laptops         | `gemma_1.1_instruct_2b_en` |\n| 2B              | Pretrained        | Code Completion in Mobile Device   | `code_gemma_2b_en` |\n| 7B              | Pretrained        | Desktop computers and small servers| `gemma_7b_en`          |\n| 7B              | Instruction tuned | Desktop computers and small servers| `gemma_1.1_instruct_7b_en` |\n| 7B              | Instruction tuned | Code Completion in Desktop computers| `code_gemma_7b_en` |\n\nIn this notebook, we will utilize the `Gemma 1.1 2b-it` model from KerasNLP's pretrained models to solve the math olympiad questions.

This process starts with tokenization, where input strings are converted into sequences of token IDs.\n\n**Why it's important:** Initially, raw text data is complex and challenging for modeling due to its high dimensionality. By converting text into a compact set of tokens, such as transforming `\"The quick brown fox\"` into `[\"the\", \"qu\", \"##ick\", \"br\", \"##own\", \"fox\"]`, we simplify the data. Many models rely on special tokens and additional tensors to understand input. These tokens help divide input and identify padding, among other tasks. Making all sequences the same length through padding boosts computational efficiency, making subsequent steps smoother.\n\nExplore the following pages to access the available preprocessing and tokenizer layers in **KerasNLP**:\n- [Preprocessing](https://keras.io/api/keras_nlp/preprocessing_layers/)\n- [Tokenizers](https://keras.io/api/keras_nlp/tokenizers/)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"x, y, sample_weight = gemma_lm.preprocessor(data[0:2])","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-19T14:18:09.095219Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-19T14:18:09.095582Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-19T14:18:09.443047Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-19T14:18:09.095551Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-19T14:18:09.442022Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This preprocessing layer will take in batches of strings, and return outputs in a `(x, y, sample_weight)` format, where the `y` label is the next token id in the `x` sequence.\n\nFrom the code below, we can see that, after the preprocessor, the data shape is `(num_samples, sequence_length)`.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Display the shape of each processed output\nfor k, v in x.items():\n    print(k, \":\", v.shape)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-19T14:18:09.444468Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-19T14:18:09.444834Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-19T14:18:09.450519Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-19T14:18:09.444801Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-19T14:18:09.449607Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Inference before Fine-Tuning\n\nBefore we do fine-tuning, let's see how Gemma model responds with some prepared prompts.\n\n> As this model is not yet fine-tuned for instruction, you will notice that the model's responses are inaccurate.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Sample 1","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Take one sample\nrow = df.iloc[12]\n\n# Generate Prompt using template\nprompt = template.format(\n    problem=row.problem,\n    solution=\"\",\n)\n\n# Infer\noutput = gemma_lm.generate(prompt, max_length=1024)\n\n# Colorize\noutput = colorize_text(output)\n\n# Display in markdown\ndisplay(Markdown(output))\n","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-19T14:18:09.451781Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-19T14:18:09.452566Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-19T14:18:26.254776Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-19T14:18:09.452534Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-19T14:18:26.25356Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Sample 2","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Take one sample\nrow = df.iloc[32]\n\n# Generate Prompt using template\nprompt = template.format(\n    problem=row.problem,\n    solution=\"\"\n)\n\n# Infer\noutput = gemma_lm.generate(prompt, max_length=1024)\n\n# Colorize\noutput = colorize_text(output)\n\n# Display in markdown\ndisplay(Markdown(output))\n","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-19T14:18:26.256154Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-19T14:18:26.256488Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-19T14:18:27.901428Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-19T14:18:26.25646Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-19T14:18:27.900201Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Fine-tuning with LoRA\n\nTo get better responses from the model, we will fine-tune the model with Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA).\n\n**What exactly is LoRA?**\n\nLoRA is a method used to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) in an efficient way. It involves freezing the weights of the LLM and injecting trainable rank-decomposition matrices.\n\nImagine in an LLM, we have a pre-trained dense layer, represented by a $d \\times d$ weight matrix, denoted as $W_0$. We then initialize two additional dense layers, labeled as $A$ and $B$, with shapes $d \\times r$ and $r \\times d$, respectively. Here, $r$ denotes the rank, which is typically **much smaller than** $d$. Prior to LoRA, the model's output was computed using the equation $output = W_0 \\cdot x + b_0$, where $x$ represents the input and $b_0$ denotes the bias term associated with the original dense layer, which remains frozen. After applying LoRA, the equation becomes $output = (W_0 \\cdot x + b_0) + (B \\cdot A \\cdot x)$, where $A$ and $B$ denote the trainable rank-decomposition matrices that have been introduced.\n\n<center><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/DWsbhLg/LoRA.png\" width=\"300\"><br/>\nCredit: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685\">LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models</a> Paper</center>\n\n\nIn the LoRA paper, $A$ is initialized with $\\mathcal{N} (0, \\sigma^2)$ and $B$ with $0$, where $\\mathcal{N}$ denotes the normal distribution, and $\\sigma^2$ is the variance.\n\n**Why does LoRA save memory?**\n\nEven though we're adding more layers to the model with LoRA, it actually helps save memory. This is because the smaller layers (A and B) have fewer parameters to learn compared to the big model and fewer trainable parameters mean fewer optimizer variables to store. So, even though the overall model might seem bigger, it's actually more efficient in terms of memory usage. \n\n> This notebook uses a LoRA rank of `4`.
